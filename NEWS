Version 0.50.1, released 1st March 2015
---------------------------------------

Changes:
* Fire subsystem (see below).
* Made hunger/burden/tiredness state printing code more elegant.
* Screenshots will be saved to ~/IvanScrshot/ (this directory can be changed to preference at line 308 of whandler.cpp).
* Added Blob's drawing of Ivan and Vlad to GC8 entry.
* Total equipment weight shown in equip screen.
* Added NetHack Keybinding Option.
* Cha affects Wand of Resurrection taming.
* Add Spider Retrieval side quest.

Fire subsystem:
* Intoduced new material variables of Transient and Steady State thermal energy. Transient is responsible for enabling damage from multiple explosions to accumulate, triggering higher thresholds of activation energy for materials like dragon hide, etc. Transient stored energy de-accumulates with the Be() function. Steady state stores the accumulated energy and is decremented only when the burning object is in contact with a fluid, f. ex. water. once Steady State reached zero, then the flames on the object are extinguished.
* Fire resistances have been added for materials.
* There is an extinguish function for putting out flames on objects that are on fire. Extinguish() needs to be properly generalised so that the thermal energies reach zero when this function is called (another thing for the to-do list).
* Graded charring in the bitmap, achieved by selecting the RGB colour with the max intensity, RSHIFT max intensity by 2, RSHIFT old RGB by 3 and then add these together with Max>>2 to form the new 'burnt' RGB values.
* Added the visuals for items after they ignite. Only ignition source is due to explosions so far. Not sure if the Activation Energy for items should be lowered, but if it is too low then the whole dungeon will ignite.
* Different materials now have different burn times. BurnModifier() determines the duration of burning based on material strength, fire resistance and density.
* Materials now "Burn", if they are burning, and go through the stages not burnt, slightly burnt, moderately burnt and heavily burnt.
* Strength value of the material decreases according to its degree of burnedness (NOT_BURNT, MODERATELY_BURNT etc.).
* Solids no longer sparkle when they are burnt, but do again when they are repaired.
* Objects are destroyed once they are completely burnt up, as per spoiling, rusting subsystems.
* Made it so that books and scrolls catch fire like normal items do, but only after being tested for instantly burning away.
* Burnt scrolls are illegible, unless you are intelligent enough to decipher them.
* Phoenix feather materials "rise from the ashes" upon complete combustion.
* Prevented wooden flaming swords from catching fire.
* Melee weapons can be dipped when on fire, no fluid, and not both.
* Armors can now be dipped but only when on fire and no other fluid is present.
* Blood puts out flames.
* Made it more likely for raindrops and vomit to put out fires. At the moment, normal items do not accumulate raindrops via this mechanism, only gear.
* Made it so that the words "(on fire)" appear in the post-fix of meleeweapons and armors that are on fire, a la fluids (covered in ...).

Fixes:
* Found that materials no longer sparkle if dipped in fluids, and no longer resume sparkling even after the fluid has evaporated - which is a BUG!
* Fixed a provisional bug where scrolls and books could be dipped without being on fire.
* Ghosts, powder, fluids were all burning. Even the snow in Attnam was on fire! This was fixed for gases, fluids and powders.
* Fixed window bug.
* Removed test1 and test2 sirens.
* Fixed typo in Atavus X-mas message.
* If a character other than the player had polycontrol and lycanthropy, then the player would be prompted to decide whether the lycanthropic character would polymorph.
* Important fix for 64-bit systems that prevents segfault when loading a save file.

* Bugfix for off-center loading animation.
* Typo fixes.
* Fixed bug in gods.cpp that caused game to not display the last time the player prayed to Valpurus and Mortifer.
* Fixed Silva Earthquake crashing on GC6.
* Player or NPC being struck by mine-activated mustard gas no longer causes a crash.

* Fixed the shop door creation bug (dungeon script files).
* "Fixed" Elite guard taming: TamingDifficulty = 30.
* Double checked that Ommel Cerumen cannot be wished for (this is therefore fixed).
* Fixed the library exploit.
* Fixed the banana room exploit.
* Holy hand grenade arm and drop in cathedral now go to dwarf room.
* Mustard gas hostility bug fixed.
* Fixed the drinking pea soup in the world map bug by including a check to avoid attempting to place a gas cloud in over world.
