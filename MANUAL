Fellow adventurer, turn back while you can! For here begins the roguelike
Iter Vehemens ad Necem, a Violent Road to Death. If you choose to travel along
it, you will dive into countless exciting adventures to gain items of great
magic, attain powerful equipment made of mysterious materials, bathe in
the blessings of mighty gods and recruit loyal allies of various shapes and
sizes. Unfortunately, along the way you will also often be dangerously injured,
poisoned, catch numerous diseases, lose several limbs and transform into
manifold different kinds of pitiful creatures in the darkest depths of hostile
dungeons. And, at the end of the road, you are bound to perish in a most
gruesome and painful way.

Don't say we didn't warn you.



Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) is a graphical roguelike game which currently
runs on Windows, DOS, Linux, and OS X. It features advanced body part and
material handling, multi-colored lighting and, above all, deep game play.

This is a fan continuation of IVAN by members of the Cathedral of Attnam forum.

% FAQ %

Q: There are hundreds of roguelikes out there and they are all the same.
   Why would I want to try out IVAN?
A: Listing might be the most convenient way to answer this question:

   Body part system:
     Remember Monty Python and the Holy Grail? All body parts in IVAN have
     separate armors and separate hit points. After you've found your first
     good weapons, you will be able to reduce some monsters to helpless
     torsos by mutilating them frivolously! The game rewards brutality by
     showing its results graphically. Brutality can also be applied to you,
     though, so it's best to have a remedy available in case of a lost limb.

   Material and equipment system:
     Unlike any other roguelike, there is a certain definition in IVAN for,
     say, a longsword. However, the material of a longsword can be anything
     at all. If you have been lucky enough to get a scroll of change material,
     you will be able to turn your 'iron longsword' to a 'mithril longsword',
     but also to a 'bread longsword' if you, for some reason, wanted to eat
     a bread that is shaped like a longsword (I'm not saying it's a good idea,
     but it's not impossible). Another example: you might also want to turn your
     'leather boots of strength +1' to much stronger 'phoenix feather boots
     of strength +1'. Besides allowing you to upgrade your equipment in
     a fresh way, the material system makes it possible for the game engine to
     easily generate lots of different objects in the dungeons for your use and
     amusement.

   Graphic effects:
     IVAN has advanced graphics more than comparable to many modern roguelikes.
     "But graphics are useless in a roguelike!" you might exclaim. You would
     probably reconsider such an opinion when following a wounded and panicked
     monster according to its trail of blood. Besides that, you'll face
     dynamically generated and animated flames, smoke, auras, weather effects,
     explosions, sources of colored light, water and much more.

   General gameplay:
     IVAN brings gameplay issues further than most roguelikes, while still
     remaining easy to play. Besides the body part system and the material and
     equipment system there are such curiosities as 2x2 monsters, wandering
     mercenaries and slaves which you can recruit/buy, smiths and tailors who
     can repair broken equipment, and monsters which are able to reproduce.
     The game also features many different deities ranging from chaotic to
     neutral and lawful. Each god has its own specialties and altars, and
     you will be able to affect your own alignment by the way you play.
     And on the top of all that, IVAN's storyline will keep you pumped with
     its unique events!

Q: Help, I have no idea what am I doing!
A: IVAN works pretty much in the same way as other roguelikes. The player
   controls a character, which moves and attacks from the direction keys.
   All other commands can be found by pressing '?' key in the game.

Q: What does "Iter Vehemens ad Necem" mean?
A: It's Latin and means "Violent Road to Death". For most players, that's
   a perfect description of the typical game.

Q: Why is my save deleted when I die?
A: Like the creators of other roguelikes, we think this makes gaming much
   more exciting, since you must take full responsibility of all your
   actions. You have only one chance to live or die. Also, we agree that
   "normal" save-loading is OK for games which remain the same in all gaming
   sessions, since in these you are not meant to really die as replaying
   everything in exactly the same way would be annoying. But the same does
   not apply to games with a multitude of random areas and events like IVAN;
   the whole fun is trying again and again in ever-changing environment,
   encountering stranger and more complex situations and becoming better
   and better in tackling them.

Q: Can't you reconsider your opinion about saveloading?
A: No. There are the two things we swore never to do when starting the
   project: discarding permadeath and making IVAN a 3D action game. Don't
   bother us about this question anymore.

Q: Not even as an "easy" game option? Pretty please?
A: Shut up.

Q: What do these strange markings like Dex, Agi mean in the right sidebar?
A:
   AStr = Arm Strength   Increases melee and thrown damage.
   LStr = Leg Strength   Increases carrying capacity and kicking damage.
   Dex  = Dexterity      Increases attack speed and accuracy.
   Agi  = Agility        Increases movement speed and dodging ability.
   End  = Endurance      Increases maximum health points and healing rate.
   Per  = Perception     Increases sight range, accuracy and dodging ability.
   Int  = Intelligence   Increases your ability to read and use magic scrolls.
   Will = Willpower      Increases resistance to mental effects and magic.
   Wis  = Wisdom         Increases your ability to deal with the gods.
   Cha  = Charisma       Increases your ability to haggle and make deals.
   Mana = Mana           Increases your ability to use magical items.

   If there are two numbers visible after these the first is the attribute
   after bonuses and penalties obtained from your equipment or some other
   temporary reason. The second number shows the base attribute without the
   said modifications. If there is no net-bonus or net-minus, only the base
   attribute is shown.

   If the first number is yellow, then it has increased a short while ago, and
   if it is red it has decreased.

   Ht   = Height         Your height in centimeters, or length of body for
                         animals. Increases your health points, but also your
                         enemies' chance to hit you.
   Wt   = Weight         Your weight in kilograms.

   HP   = Health Points  The sum of your body parts' health.

   Gold                  The amount of money you have.
   Day & Time            The in-game time you have spent in this playthrough.
   Turn                  The number of turns (commands which take time) you have
                         used in this playthrough.

Q: I had 20 HP, but I still died. Is this a bug?
A: No, this is not a bug. You will die (at least in human form) if the HP of
   your groin, torso or head reach 0.

Q: Why do I always miss spiders with my trusty iron mace?
A: Mace is far too big for hitting small creatures. Do you really kill
   spiders with such enormous objects in real life?

Q: What do marks like L+, C-- mean in the pray menu?
A: All gods have a property that tells whether they are supporters of Law
   or Chaos or if they are Neutral. This is however too general description
   so the pluses and minuses tell of slight differences between the gods.
   Eg. Valpurus has the letters L++ this means that Valpurus is extremely
   lawful, when Sophos has the letters L-, which in turn means that Sophos
   is lawful, but still leaning a bit towards neutrality and even chaos.

Q: I just lost a leg. How do I get it back?
A: Priests, gods, certain potions and magical items may help you.

Q: How is score calculated?
A: First the kills of the player and his pets are merged to a single
   list. Then for every monster type, the score is calculated with the
   following formula:

     Score = sqrt(a) * b * b

   sqrt(a) = Square root of the number of killed monsters of this type.
   b = Sum of the attributes of a typical monster of this type.

   The individual scores of the monster types are then added together.

   You also get a high bonus for winning, depending on your victory type
   (the score is multiplied by 2, 3, 4 or 5).

Q: Why does time pass so fast in the game?
A: Who has said the a day is as long in IVAN's world as on Earth?

Q: How can I compile IVAN source code?
A: See INSTALL.

Q: I am a Linux / OS X user. Why can't I access the wizard (cheat) mode?
A: The wizard mode functions aren't compiled by default. Change
   the environment variable CXXFLAGS to -DWIZARD and recompile.

Q: I am a DOS user. When I try to run IVAN, I get the message "Load error:
   no DPMI - Get csdpmi\b.zip".
A: The DOS binary is compiled using DJGPP, so you need a DPMI server to run
   it. One should have been provided along with IVAN, but if that's not the
   case, download it from www.delorie.com.

Q: I've found a bug. What should I do?
A: Write a small description on how the bug occurred and if possible even
   how we could replicate it, and report this bug on our GitHub page or the
   forum:

     https://github.com/Attnam/ivan
     http://attnam.com

   You should mention your full name so we can credit you , if you are the first
   to discover this bug.

Q: I've got a great idea to make IVAN better! What should I do?
A: Post the idea on our forum (see above). You will be credited if we
   implement the feature, it's non-trivial, and you're first to suggest it.

Q: I'm a programmer willing to help you. What should I do?
A: Join us on GitHub!

   Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository and then once you have
   made and tested your changes, submit a pull request. It will be reviewed
   by one of the admins as soon as possible.

   See .customs.emacs file for the official Ivan C++ Programming Style.

Q: Will there be a Russian/Chinese/Esperato/etc. version?
A: No, unless you make it.

Q: How do I buy and sell stuff in shops?
A: Pick items up to buy them, and drop what you want to sell.

Q: What do the weapon and armor stats mean?
A: Let's see:

     an adamantine short sword covered in blood +6 [1000g, DAM 9-16,
     extremely accurate, almost unbreakable, skill 16/0]

   This short sword is made of adamantine, covered in blood, enchanted up to +6,
   weights 1000 grams, has the given damage range, is very accurate and very
   durable, and your skill with the weapon category is 16, while your
   accustomization with this specific sword is 0.

     a phoenix feather armor of great health +7 [1000g, AV 13]

   This armor of great health is made of phoenix feather material,
   enchanted up to +7, weights 1000 grams, and has Armor Value (AV) of 13.

Q: A corpse of a large hedgehog is worth 6000 gold pieces?!
A: No, as we just told you, that's its weight in grams!

Q: Help, I still have no idea what am I doing!
A: In this case, you might like our wiki:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Random Name Generator Patterns %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Set a pattern for the random fantasy name generator. When you start
a game with no pre-set name, the generator will create a name based
on this pattern. The letters s, v, V, c, B, C, i, m, M, D, and d
represent different types of random replacements. Everything else
is produced literally.

  s - generic syllable
  v - vowel
  c - consonant
  B - consonant or consonant combination suitable for beginning a word
  C - consonant or consonant combination suitable anywhere in a word
  i - insult
  m - mushy name
  M - mushy name ending
  D - consonant suited for a stupid person's name
  d - syllable suited for a stupid person's name (begins with a vowel)

All characters between parenthesis () are produced literally. For example,
the pattern "s(dim)", produces a random generic syllable followed by "dim".

Characters between angle brackets <> produce patterns from the table above.
Imagine the entire pattern is wrapped in one of these.

In both types of groupings, a vertical bar | denotes a random choice.
Empty groups are allowed. For example, "(foo|bar)" produces either
"foo" or "bar". The pattern "<c|v|>" produces a constant, vowel, or
nothing at all.

An exclamation point ! means to capitalize the component that follows
it. For example, "!(foo)" will produce "Foo" and "v!s" will produce a
lowercase vowel followed by a capitalized syllable, like "eRod".

A tilde ~ means to reverse the letters of the component that follows
it. For example, "~(foo)" will produce "oof". To reverse an entire
template, wrap it in brackets. For example, to reverse "sV'i" as
a whole use "~<sV'i>". The template "~sV'i" will only reverse
the initial syllable.
