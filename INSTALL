Compiling IVAN under different systems
--------------------------------------

Under Linux and OS X, type:

cmake .
make -j
make install

Note: Wizard Mode is disabled by default. To enable it run:

cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-DWIZARD .
make -j
make install

--------------------------------------

Under DOS:

If you have DJGPP 2.03+ and gcc 2.952+
installed, type:

make -f ivandj.mak

--------------------------------------

Under Win32:

If you have MinGW 1.1+ and gcc
2.95.3-6+ installed, type:

make -f ivanmgw.mak

If you have VC++ 5.0+ installed,
just open IVAN.dsw and build the
Main project.

For both compilers you need to
install SDL development libraries,
which can be downloaded from:
