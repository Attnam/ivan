Compiling IVAN under different systems
--------------------------------------

To build IVAN from source, you need to have the following dependencies
installed on your system:

- compiler with C++11 support (e.g. Clang 3.3 or newer, GCC 4.8 or newer)
- CMake (https://cmake.org) version 2.8.12.2 or newer
- SDL (https://www.libsdl.org) version 1.2 or newer, at least 2.0 recommended
- libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)

--------------------------------------

Under Linux and OS X, type:

cmake .
make -j
make install

Note: Wizard Mode is disabled by default. To enable it run:

cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DWIZARD" .
make -j
make install

To install IVAN to a custom prefix, pass the additional flag
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/prefix/path to the cmake invocation.
(In particular, simply doing `make DESTDIR=/your/prefix/path install`
doesn't work because IVAN needs the prefix information at build-time.)

If config option toggle is too fast, you can add this flag -DFELIST_WAITKEYUP, like: 
cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DFELIST_WAITKEYUP -DWIZARD" .
(you may chose what flags to add independently).

--------------------------------------

Under DOS:

If you have DJGPP 2.03+ and gcc 2.952+
installed, type:

make -f ivandj.mak

--------------------------------------

Under Windows - Visual Studio:


Install SDL2

Download SDL2-devel-2.0.4-VC.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/
and install somewhere in system, e.g. D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4


Set system environment variable SDL2DIR to "D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4".
Make sure to open command prompt after that (so this variable is taken into account).

Alternatively set it just in current command prompt:

D:\buildy\ivan>set SDL2DIR=D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4


Compile IVAN

Either use cmake-gui if system environment variable was set, or:

D:\buildy\ivan>mkdir vs2015
D:\buildy\ivan>cd vs2015
D:\buildy\ivan\vs2015>cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=D:/buildy/ivan/inst_vs2015

Now open and compile D:\buildy\ivan\vs2015\ivan.sln in VS2015 IDE.

Now you can run ivan from D:/buildy/ivan/inst_vs2015/ivan/ directory.

--------------------------------------

Under Windows - MinGW:


Install SDL2

Download SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz from http://www.libsdl.org/
and install somewhere in system, e.g. D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw

Set environment variable SDL2DIR to "D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\".
Make sure to open command prompt after that (so this variable is taken into account).

Alternatively set it just in current command prompt:

set SDL2DIR=D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\

Use command line to generate MinGW makefiles in IVAN source directory:

D:\buildy\ivan>mkdir mingw
D:\buildy\ivan>cd mingw
D:\buildy\ivan\mingw2>cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=D:/buildy/ivan/inst_mingw

Now you can compile from command line:

D:\buildy\ivan\mingw2>mingw32-make -j4 install

If you get a lot of weird compilation errors, try invoking cmake again with
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=gnu++11' as a workaround.

Now you can run ivan from D:/buildy/ivan/inst_mingw/ivan/ directory.

--------------------------------------

Under Windows - MSYS2:


Download MSYS2 from http://www.msys2.org/ selecting the right download for your architecture.
Follow instructions on the page to install correctly.

Run MSYS2.exe from either the "-msys64" or "-msys32" folder, depending on your system, and type these commands
$ pacman -Syu
Proceed with installation (option Y), then exit by closing the terminal window. The terminal window will crash and burn eventually but may take some time to do so.

Run MSYS2.exe again:
$ pacman -Su
proceed with installation (option Y). This will take a long time to download all the packages, depending on your download speed

$ pacman -S git
Proceed with installation (option Y) etcetera

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc

$ pacman -S make

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-cmake

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-libpng

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL2

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-SDL2_mixer

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-pkg-config

Now the MSYS2 build system is installed, you only need to follow the instructions below to keep IVAN up to date

Create an empty folder in \ivan\ called msys2
run MinGW32.exe (from your "-msys64" or "-msys32" folder, whichever is applicable) and change directory to your newly created \ivan\msys2\ folder

In MinGW32.exe type the following commands, respecting the direction of the slashes:
$ cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/ivan/inst_msys2
$ make -j4 install

Navigate to \ivan\inst_msys2\ivan and you will find the ivan.exe executable!

You will probably need to copy a bunch of DLLs into the directory where ivan.exe is located. These may include the following, likely not an exhaustive list, but they can be found under for example C:\-msys64\mingw32\bin:
libpng16-16.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll
zlib.dll
libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
libSDL2_mixer-2-0-0.dll
libmad-0.dll


Use dependencywalker if you need to check for missing libraries, and if you get the message: "error cannot find entrypoint inflateValidate (in dll libpng16-16.dll)" then you need to include zlib1.dll
