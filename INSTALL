Compiling IVAN under different systems
--------------------------------------

To build IVAN from source, you need to have the following dependencies
installed on your system:

- compiler with C++11 support (e.g. Clang 3.3 or newer, GCC 4.8 or newer)
- CMake (https://cmake.org) version 2.8.12.2 or newer
- SDL (https://www.libsdl.org) version 1.2 or newer, at least 2.0 recommended

--------------------------------------

Under Linux and OS X, type:

cmake .
make -j
make install

Note: Wizard Mode is disabled by default. To enable it run:

cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-DWIZARD .
make -j
make install

To install IVAN to a custom prefix, pass the additional flag
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/your/prefix/path to the cmake invocation.
(In particular, simply doing `make DESTDIR=/your/prefix/path install`
doesn't work because IVAN needs the prefix information at build-time.)

--------------------------------------

Under DOS:

If you have DJGPP 2.03+ and gcc 2.952+
installed, type:

make -f ivandj.mak

--------------------------------------

Under Windows - Visual Studio:


Install SDL2

Download SDL2-devel-2.0.4-VC.zip from http://www.libsdl.org/
and install somewhere in system, e.g. D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4


Set system environment variable SDL2DIR to "D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4".
Make sure to open command prompt after that (so this variable is taken into account).

Alternatively set it just in current command prompt:

D:\buildy\ivan>set SDL2DIR=D:\Apps\SDL2-2.0.4


Compile IVAN

Either use cmake-gui if system environment variable was set, or:

D:\buildy\ivan>mkdir vs2015
D:\buildy\ivan>cd vs2015
D:\buildy\ivan\vs2015>cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=D:/buildy/ivan/inst_vs2015

Now open and compile D:\buildy\ivan\vs2015\ivan.sln in VS2015 IDE.

Now you can run ivan from D:/buildy/ivan/inst_vs2015/ivan/ directory.

--------------------------------------

Under Windows - MinGW:


Install SDL2

Download SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw.tar.gz from http://www.libsdl.org/
and install somewhere in system, e.g. D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw

Set environment variable SDL2DIR to "D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\".
Make sure to open command prompt after that (so this variable is taken into account).

Alternatively set it just in current command prompt:

set SDL2DIR=D:\Apps\SDL2-devel-2.0.4-mingw\SDL2-2.0.4\i686-w64-mingw32\

Use command line to generate MinGW makefiles in IVAN source directory:

D:\buildy\ivan>mkdir mingw
D:\buildy\ivan>cd mingw
D:\buildy\ivan\mingw2>cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=D:/buildy/ivan/inst_mingw

Now you can compile from command line:

D:\buildy\ivan\mingw2>mingw32-make -j4 install

If you get a lot of weird compilation errors, try invoking cmake again with
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-std=gnu++11' as a workaround.

Now you can run ivan from D:/buildy/ivan/inst_mingw/ivan/ directory.
