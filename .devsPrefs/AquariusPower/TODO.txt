FIX-CRITICAL

FIX-IMPORTANT
- validate the existance of all generated savegame files, it is stored in the .sav file, would crash if missing so better just promptly look for them...
- disappearing pet angel wont drop all equipped items (the ones we give'm and would not normally disappear...), namely torso armor at least

FIX-MINOR
- center on player after polymorphing back from a ghost while in a wall when we get teleported randomly and a glitch (xBRZ around) happens using 0,0 (probably) position as img source to blit
- by remembering the previously selected entry list, sometimes the wrong savegame is being loaded, not the "apparently" selected one...
- skeleton dog shouldn't pee..., but could say "tries to pee but nothing happens" :)
- pet with poly ring and polycontrol ring, polymorphing into ghost then into bunny, when back to human will not re-equip
- deny showitemsunder if lantern is on the wall? (amulet of phasing)
- when felist is open, still showing tiny dungeon animated behind...
- the last entry in the savegame list, even after imported, may still show as being in the previous version and after importing a new player name may be used and so a new savegame created, quite a mess... (quite confuse this one, may be a unique bug that only happens when importing some specific random rare old saves...)

IMPROVEMENTS
- mine::WillExplode() if stepper is trying to pickup, check if levitating and 25+ dexterity (or only dexterity but harder like x2) to let it be disarmed and safely picked up
- craft dismantle w/o forge should require dagger and hammer if has any meltable
 - craft test material should allow broken things too
 - craft if sat on a chair should lower craft time too
 - craft tools should take damage too, mainly if the worked materials are harder
- felist: default remember_selected
- simple pile equal items on "show items under", ex.: if more than 1, simply draw a tiny + sign with 2 drawn white lines
 - show items under, begin with the last one, unless if showing them all in lines
- mini map unfold slowly once per frame one dungeon line of squares animation
- remove flag CanBeDestroyed from items that can be crafted? or deny their crafting? or keep as on fumble creates lump?
- show material Str only if in possession of the materials book
 - inventory 'i' will be selectable if in possession of the materials book and chosing will show at most 2 lines as filter to the book
- pickup accept many using the same pickup key ',' at least see the other keys  cfgs too

NEW STUFF
- draw the current equipped amulet on the player
- sfx "It smells oddly intelligent here." the good smoke as opposed to "a sinister stench surrounds you" the bad smoke

==================================================================================================================
DONE:
- add a lsquare token during detect material to highlight the square, the guessed luminance fails at daylight 13:02h
- quick swap weapons hotkey, to also reequip after mining interrupted
- hum?? walk over friendly: chat and wait one turn to let it move
- ?make pet always follow very closely to avoid getting lost from the player? or that is part of the troubles/difficulty? :)
- make pet look at last 3 squares player walked before waiting
- sfx for .*hit.* it is matching white :P
- list item zoom xBRZ, draw the background behind it to make the blending work properly all times!
- craft fluid extraction should not require a specific previous location to resume
- dupPlayerBugFix: check also for duplicity of TrapIDMap as crashing on save
- optionally auto inscribe some map notes like altars, anvil, chair etc
- the materials book could be filtered by typing (felist already can filter anything)
