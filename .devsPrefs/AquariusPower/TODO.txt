FIX
- skeleton dog shouldn't pee...
- pet with poly ring and polycontrol ring, polymorphing into ghost then into bunny, when back to human will not re-equip
- deny showitemsunder if lantern is on the wall? (amulet of phasing)
- when felist is open, still showing tiny dungeon animated behind...

IMPROVEMENTS
- craft dismantle w/o forge should require dagger and hammer if has any meltable
 - craft test material should allow broken things too
- felist: default remember_selected
- simple pile equal items on "show items under", ex.: if more than 1, simply draw a tiny + sign with 2 drawn white lines
 - show items under, begin with the last one, unless if showing them all in lines
- mini map unfold slowly once per frame one dungeon line of squares animation
- remove flag CanBeDestroyed from items that can be crafted? or deny their crafting? or keep as on fumble creates lump?
- the materials book could be filtered by typing
 - show material Str only if in possession of the materials book
 - inventory 'i' will be selectable if in possession of the materials book and chosing will show at most 2 lines as filter to the book
- pickup accept many using the same pickup key ',' at least see the other keys  cfgs too

NEW STUFF
- draw the current equipped amulet on the player
- sfx "It smells oddly intelligent here." the good smoke as opposed to "a sinister stench surrounds you" the bad smoke

DONE:
- add a lsquare token during detect material to highlight the square, the guessed luminance fails at daylight 13:02h
- quick swap weapons hotkey, to also reequip after mining interrupted
- hum?? walk over friendly: chat and wait one turn to let it move
- ?make pet always follow very closely to avoid getting lost from the player? or that is part of the troubles/difficulty? :)
- make pet look at last 3 squares player walked before waiting
- sfx for .*hit.* it is matching white :P
- list item zoom xBRZ, draw the background behind it to make the blending work properly all times!
