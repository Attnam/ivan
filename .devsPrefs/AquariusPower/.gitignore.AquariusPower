# Git ignore files are special. They are relative to their current path!
# If the one at '/.devsPrefs/SomeUserName/.gitignore' remains named like that,
# git will recognize and ignore files as that sub folder is a root folder!
# Therefore ONLY that file must be named like: '/.devsPrefs/SomeUserName/.gitignore.SomeUserName'
# And after creating the link to it, the link itself must be renamed to '.gitignore' to be again recognized by git.
