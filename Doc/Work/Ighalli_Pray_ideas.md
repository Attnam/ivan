### Gods grant spells
- Mostly function similar to most pen and paper RPGs, which I've never seen in a roguelike
- Make it obvious to the player when they can pray for additional spells
  - No hours since prayed or relying on a wiki to know how to make it work; just balance it properly
- Limited capacity for spells based on Widsom
- Deities grant better spells based on their relationship

#### Spell ideas
From lower level to higher level
##### Common spells
- Summon angel
- Forge limb
  - this would be much more difficult than it is currently
  - mostly you'll have to rely on healing liquid / healers to get a normal limb back instead
- Summon archangel

##### Valpurus
- No spells; just use Legifer and Atavus and sacrifice until champion
- When champion, auto-summon a guard as a permanent ally
  - guards could possibly upgrade eventually
  - at least be replaced some time after their deaths

##### Legifer
- Current explosion effect
- Smite enemies
- Summon arms and armor (powerful but temporary)
- Summon temporary help

##### Atavus
- Give away money to Atavus (in general, having less money = better Atavus spells granted)
- Give objects to creatures on the level
  - in general, as we add item use we should make more items start in e.g. kobold pockets and fewer on the floors, anyway
- Give objects to player

##### Seges
- Create water
- Create bread
- Remove poison
- Remove disease
- Cure wounds

##### Dulcis
- Make the player more beautiful
- Make monsters temporarily pacified
- Summon a permanent bard to follow the player and be mostly useless
- Tame enemies

##### Sophos
- Levitation
- Teleport the player
- Teleport enemies away
- Mirror self
- Teleport enemy limbs away

##### Silva
- Create water
- Summon animal allies (temporary then permanent)
- Harden Leather (and higher materials)
- Create meat
- Earthquake

##### Loricatus
- Ignite enemy equipment
- Detonate gunpowder (within LOS)
- Harden to bronze (and higher materials with higher spells)
- Break enemy equipment
- Create gunpowder

##### Mellis
- Midas touch
- Sell an object
- Teleport player to a special shop
  - be careful to not give the player too much time to heal and so forth here
- Or just buy an item through a menu
  - probably the player just 'wishes' for a class of item (a weapon category or armor or boots) and Mellis presents an option to buy
  - could lose favor by not taking him up on the offer

##### Cleptia
- Summon Poison (like a dip; fill bottles or directly poison weapons)
- Haste
- Temporarily gain Searching status (thieves & assassins = know about traps..?)
- Invisibility

##### Nefas
- Create alcohol
- Confuse enemies
- Summon vomit (can splash on adjacent tile)
- Summon mistress

##### Scabies
- Disease enemies in sight
- Polymorph player (with higher level = controlled poly)
- Polymorph other (higher level = lower creature power, but based on original power too)
- Disease all enemies on floor

##### Infuscor
- Ignite enemies
  - This is really weak now, but if fire becomes worse, it wouldn't be entry-level anymore)
- Transmute fluid to acid
  - e.g. the blood on the floors and on enemies
- Wand of necromancy duplicate
- Throw lightning

##### Cruentus
- Cause fear
- Summon troll blood
- Summon arms and armor (powerful, but temporary)
- Decapitate foe (does damage to head; not actually automatic death)

##### Mortifer
- Like today, no spells granted
- Create an Undead team (as opposed to the Enemy team) and when champion of Mortifer, they all stop attacking you and instead fight other enemies
