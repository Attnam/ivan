The Holy Stack of Valpuri,
He who carrieth our flat universe, so that it won't sink into the Sea of Eternity.

Edition according to the Holybanana-Hexist sect.

Much of the canonical Stack is in Finnish (eg. the writings of the prophet and clairvoyant Vesa, the Gospel of Timoteus and the Third Book of Timo), so this is but a torso and inadequate to convey the True Image of the Full Glory of Valpuri. We apologize for the inconvenience.
