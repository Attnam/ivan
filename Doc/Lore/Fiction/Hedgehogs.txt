Long time ago, Dulcis created the hedgehogs, at first just for fun. At these times they were what they seem, cute and harmless. Soon people began to worship these critters in the temples of Dulcis and it became the sacred animal of its creator.

Then the Great Divine War broke up and many things changed. In the later stages of the war, the followers of Scabies, the goddess of mutations and disease, altered a single hedgehog by the foulest of magic. This change was dramatic; the helpless, innocent creature was turned into a fierce menace which attacked everything it saw but for its own kin. Then the monstrous hedgehog disappeared and the followers of Dulcis rejoiced.

Few years later, the War was over and the newly created Attnamese Empire brought order where there was none before. However, all the people slowly realised the hedgehogs were different now. The old and cute ones were gone, crowded out by the fierce spawn of the first dire hedgehod. Followers of Dulcis noticed this but were unable to prevent their sacred animal from turning into a horrible beast and many worshippers perished in their attempt to break the curse and bring back the holy hedgehogs. This all led to great hunts where brave men attacked the nesting grounds of the hedgehogs, with numerous casualties on both sides.

At the present, hedgehogs have gotten rare and have taken residence in small caves and underground places. They are almost never met outsides any more, where they brought joy into the hearts of men once.
