Once there was a village
New Attnam was its name
It grew many bananas
And sold much of the same
Across the village wandered
Kaethos, with one leg short
Tourists buying bananas
Without a second thought
Huang Ming Pong stood waiting
For his meal number seven
While a priestess of nature
Prayed unto the heaven
And in a golden building
Upon a silver floor
Richel Decos stood counting
His profits just once more
His evil grin was sparkling
Not unlike his mithil coat
In memory of rivals
Friends and foes, all smote
An unhappy situation
For all previously there
Cruelty and suffering
Yet Decos did not care
But greed swift turns to anger
When taxes are on the raise
And so upon the peasants
Decos did turn his gaze
Over to the plantations
Where bananas did grow
And there picking bananas
Stood one lowly slave Joe
Now Joe was not the norm here
Hardly timid or mild
Kaethos did often call him
Quite primitive and wild
Though why Decos did chose him
Was simpler than that
He had stood out quite clearly
For his skin was white, not black
So Joe was quickly hastened
From his loved crocodile bay
To the Decos's mansion
Where Decos had much to say
"I have a task for you"
Decos began angrily
"The damn taxes are rising
But bananas sell cheaply!
To Attnam you will travel
And take with you this letter
If you don't I'll eat you
So you had really better"
Decos then stood and waited
For Joe to laugh happily
But a shock was in store
When Joe did not agree
"No" Joe refused, annoyed
"I will not take this task
Only to end up splattered
Like my incarnations past
Too often my ancestors
Have become kobold lunch
Starved tangled in a web
Or limb's eaten with a crunch
Or had their groins destroyed
By a single angry ghost
Unwisely wielded Mjolak
And ended up as toast
Killed by hoards of livings plants
Or their own angered dog
Drunk from a clear fountain
And polyed into a log
Have all their wands explode
From stepping on a mine
Found no decent weapons
And forced to wield only pine
Maybe if they are lucky
Killed by an Enner Beast
A kamikaze dwarf
Or be mystic dark frog feast
So no, I will not accept
This doom another time
New Attnam may be yours
But my life is mine!"
Decos stared in surprise
For a moment thought real hard
And then opened his mouth
"Go on, kill him guards"
'Hmm' Joe thought wisely
As he stepped back in fear
'Perhaps this was not such
A brilliant idea'
It looked like the end for Joe
Fat ladies readied to sing
But hidden up his sleeve
Joe still had one more thing
Since Joe was just a child
From quite an early age
He'd found he had the power
To use magic; a mage
Spiriting up a keyboard
The guards he did perplex
Joe pressed that fateful key
That one that they called 'X'
Suddenly Joe shone brightly
Attributes all but maxed
He summoned Justifier
And began to relax
Nine angry guards flew at him
Their limbs went flying back
So a mildly peeved Decos
Decided to attack
"Die you communist pig!"
Decos yelled at him
As if that actually had
To do with anything
A-slashing went Joe's blade
Tearing up Decos's cloak
Joe kicked him in the groin
These were the words he spoke
"Decos you big fat meanie
Up would seem to be your time
I may still let you live if
You agree to toe the line"
Decos sighed and rolled his eyes
"It's just a game, political!"
Then slashed Joe's head with his whip
And scored a massive critical
Joe collapsed to the ground
His head holding on in vein
No, it could not happen
He could not just die again!
From the heavens burst forth
An illuminating light
He would not do this, cheater
He would rejoin the fight
"But how?" Decos said stunned
As Joe retrieved his blade
And said "It seems you chose
The wrong village to invade"
And so as chaos reigned
And gore took a new meaning
A final blow was dealt
And Richel Decos died screaming
