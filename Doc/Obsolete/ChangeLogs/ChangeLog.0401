	* Ghost of Brezhnev added to char.pcx by Kahvi
	* New basic weapons added: bastard sword, battle-axe and scythe

	  balanced than our old one
	* If the handle of a weapon is made of same material as the edge, SoCM alters
	  it, too

	  lsquare.cpp
	* All wand specializations are now configurations of wand

	* Script optimizations
	* Boolean value retrieval functions of script now honor the IvanDev Naming
	  Standard
	* Changed RAND() algorithm from Nishimura's & Mashumoto's mammoth function
	  to a simpler linear congruential RNG; I know Hex doesn't like these so
	  I feel I must present a few arguments to justify my decision:
	  * I ensured that it doesn't have the low-order bit problems abundant in the
	    32-bit versions by using a 64-bit seed and discarding the possibly cycling
		bits
	  * It is easier to understand
	  * It is a one line function so it can be inlined
	  * It is three times faster
	  * It's seed can be retrieved unlike the old one's
	  * No independent observer did notice any positive effect on gameplay when
	    we switched the RNG in ancient times (well, there weren't any players :)
	  * I dare to suspect that Nishimura's & Mashumoto's RNG may be responsible
	    for the odd improbabilities happening all the time in item generation,
		increasing the gameplay's dependance on luck considerably
	* Corrected many gcc warnings given by -pedantic
	* Shortened the names of terrain graphics files because the old ones were
	  too long for the DOS version
	* Decreased AoGH's InElasticityPenaltyModifier and Possibility
