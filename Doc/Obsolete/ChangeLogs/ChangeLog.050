-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

December 10 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

  * Corrected a bug in the genie hostility code

December 10 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

  * The annoying question "Do you want to ERASE..." whatever which appeared
    after dying if the highscore file was empty or old is now less annoying
    and doesn't appear unless it's really necessary

December 10 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

  * BugFix: Very complex chain explosions caused by kicking could crash
    the game
  * BugFix: Polymorphing to Petrus in WMode crashed
  * Great War in Attnam is inactive

    outside the level, causing a crash
  * You can no longer use your vital bodyparts for golem creation

    belongs to Scabies
  * Removed the "temporary" comments that increased the probability of bone
    files being created/loaded
  * The veteran kamikaze dwarf of GC6 is no longer always on the downstairs;
    this was too nasty for those players unfortunate enough to come up
    from GC7 after being sucked there through a fountain
  * An extra confirmation is needed before the game allows the player to
    vomit at a neutral NPC; I've died too many times because of pressing
    'V' instead of 'C'

  * BugFix: No message was printed when levitation was activated, except
    if due to a BoL
  * Decreased the possibility of attribute increase and polymorph
    effects of fountains

October 29 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

  * BugFix: offering on the Silva's altar in UT4 crashed
  * BugFix: endurance exp wasn't gained if the player had a non-living
    bodypart and his binary was compiled with VC, due to a bug in
    the latter
  * Corrected many problems in bodypart special effect draw order
  * Angels might be a little more intelligent now
  * Gods may be a little wiser when choosing gift bodypart materials
  * Probably fixed an additional bug or two which I can't quite recall now

    is now more vivid, having ten different forms
  * Removed the scroll of create monster; it was never used for anything
    sensible save abuse
  * The game now displays more informative break/destroy msgs, eg.
    "something on the ground explodes", "the slave's leather armor breaks",
    etc.
  * The game now says "xxx stabs/strikes/slashes" instead of "xxx hits"
    if xxx is armed; the verb depends on the weapon
  *  Some other msgs changed, but there are still problems with these

October 3 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

  * Some mind worms added to char.pcx by Kahvi
  * Corrected a rather nasty bug, which eg. made infravision useless

September 31 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

  * Fixed a typo in the anti-explosive magical field code
  * Added distinct break messages for wands (this probably has bugs now,
    I'll fix them later)

September 30 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

  * Corrected a minor bug in characters' special effect draw order

September 30 2004 Timo Kiviluoto <holybanana@users.sourceforge.net>

    while. Henceforth, however, I wow to resume this healthful habit
  * Mistresses and dogs now have unique random science talk particles

    items and checking if the total weight of the stack is greater than the
    items' weights' sum

January 6 2004 Heikki Sairanen <firstname.lastname@tut.fi>

    have caused random crashes when changing levels)
  * Fixed a harmless light update absence bug in the cloning code
  * N simultaneously bought items in a shop can no longer cost more than N
    times one item's price (formelly this was possible since all arithmetic

  * Monsters now avoid needlessly stepping on banana peels and broken bottles
  * The nationality adjective "Attnamian" is now written "Attnamese"
  * Gear pictures are now updated correctly when an equipped item spoils

    enner beast's groin
  * It is now possible to determine the leader of a team in the script
  * It is now possible to determine how spoiled items are in the script

  * Ikiros can now remove rust from equipment
  * Fixed two bugs in Loricatus's pray effect
  * Optimized the generation of terrains and items somewhat
  * Added many new features to New Attnam

    * Priestess of Silva who offers the same services as the priest in
      Attnam but is cheaper
    * Tourist family who follow Kaethos around the town
    * Underground sumo wrestling arena, where the player can compete with
      the local sumo champion Huang Ming Pong (I will not list all the
      meticulous details of the associated events here)
    * Added two new armors which the player gets after winning the sumo
      fight
    * The banana growers now feed the sumo wrestler regularily
    * It now rains in the village occasionally
  * Lowered the player's starting money

    past lives; also their names now depend on them
  * Master necromancers can now sometimes raise Xinroch, if he hasn't
    been generated yet
  * Apprentice necromancers can now raise any corpse he sees as a zombie
    (not just an adjacent one), and masters any corpse in the level
  * Necromancers are now somewhat more intelligent

December 16 2003 Timo Kiviluoto <firstname.lastname@hut.fi>

  * Adjusted the colors of menus and lists so that the selected item is
    more clearly visible on dark monitors
  * Large spider, giant spider and Lada added to char.pcx by Kahvi
  * Expensive camera and miniature mummy of Lenin added to item.pcx by Kahvi
  * Necromancer, bourgeois tourist, his wife and child, and Lenin added to
    humanoid.pcx by Kahvi
  * Necromancer graphics integrated
  * Two spider webs added to effect.pcx by Kahvi
  * Remade felist entry picture drawing system; browsing an enormous inventory
    (for instance after using the gain all items cheat) is now a lot faster
  * A small typo in the look description of neutral panicked NPCs corrected
  * Added a super-fast system for retrieving random pixels for which a certain
    predicate (say, non-transparency) is true; I plan to use a similiar
    algorithm for level::RandomSquare in the future
  * Documented stack.h/cpp and fluid.h/cpp
  * Added ironalloy material category which currently consists of iron, steel,
    meteoric steel and adamant
  * Iron alloys can now rust; names and strength values are affected
  * Rusting is now displayed graphically as random brown pixels
  * Added RustModifier material database member which determines the ability
    to rust for liquids and how easily rusting happens for ironalloys
  * Golems and terrains made of ironalloys can also rust
  * Scroll of repair can now remove rust
  * Renamed class human to playerkind
  * Rewrote the player's armor drawing code; it was probably the most horrible
    gum solution in the entire game
  * Added several item database members to control which armor pictures
    are to be drawn
  * Added (half-accidentally) support for armor picture animations
  * The Shirt of the Golden Eagle now gives the player an appropriate blue aura
    when worn
  * The priority map trickery which is used to determine the special effect
    drawing order of humanoids is now completely incomprehensible
  * Remade the whole fluid code: it now utilizes the full power of IVAN's
    material system
    * Liquids on ground can now cause effects to legs/other bodyparts
    * An arbitrary number of fluids can now cover weapons, armor and
      bodyparts; graphical effects added to item pictures
    * Fluids can now affect the items and bodyparts they cover
    * Removed the obsolete ContainedMaterial of weapons
    * Fluid is now displayed over wielded, armor and bodypart graphics
      for playerkinds; however I chose not to show them for other monsters
      since it could cause many characters to be drawn very unclearly
      from the user's perpective
    * Added a dripping animation for all fluids not on ground
    * Damaging a monster with a weapon now causes blood to be spilled
      over the item used
    * Dipping to solid materials is alas no longer possible; however, I
      haven't done this since 0.311 so it isn't so great a loss
    * Liquids can now exist on non-walkable terrain and affect them.
      For instance you can destroy walls using acid (see below).
      However, there is a small problem that liquids can be seen from
      all sides of the terrain which can be strange if it is a part of a
      long wall separating parallel tunnels
    * Fluids can now emit light (but this feature is not yet used)
  * A potion which breaks due to hitting an object now spills half of
    its contents to the next square on its theoretical line of flight
  * Fluids affected by paranormal gravitational distractions now land
    correctly on the players face, if he/she/it has one
  * Corpses now spill blood, not just severed bodyparts
  * Added acid effects which are based on the Acidicity material database
    member; acidous fluids cause items to break and can destroy very weak
    broken items, and they also tend to be very rusting
  * Added IsImmuneToAcid material database boolean
  * Dark frog blood and pepsi are now acidous
  * Remade the vomit system; the amount of liquid now depends on the body
    volume of the character and it can be targeted to adjacent squares
    and used as a very poor acid-based weapon
  * Added BloodMaterial and VomitMaterial character database members
  * Mommos now really attack by vomiting acidous slime, which also has
    a high RustModifier
  * Oree's vomit attack now really spills acidous blood over the player
  * M-color 3 of arm pictures is henceforth allocated for gauntlets;
    some humanoid graphics updated due to this
  * Zombies now spoil

November 8 2003 Heikki Sairanen <firstname.lastname@tut.fi>

  * feio.cpp documented

August 31 2003 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>
  
  * Now compiles with gcc
  * Added necromancers
  * Mushrooms inherit their stats.
  * Atavus gives player a banana at XMas. Banana should probably be changed to something else.

August 14 2003 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

  * Certain small changes to mihail so it know finds it's missing FeLib...

  Added instructions to create symbolic link to FeLib, if it isn't distributed for the user.

August 14 2003 Timo Kiviluoto <markku.kiviluoto@sono.fimnet.fi>

  * Added some comments to the Febot code
  * Hex's new MIHAIL version added to CVS

August 14 2003 Timo Kiviluoto <markku.kiviluoto@sono.fimnet.fi>

  * iosystem::StringQuestion now takes the destination string as an argument
    and returns whether the user aborted the question or not
  * Configuration system has been standardized and moved largely to FeLib
  * Added Febot engine which can be used by the Oracle of the Holy Haven of Gurus
    when the time comes
