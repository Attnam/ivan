	* CarryingStrength has now a minimum of one so that effectively 2500 grams
	  can be carried even without legs
	* Blitting no longer crashes when width or height is <= zero after clipping

	* The Ferocius Luxification Bug fixed
	* level::Luxify() renamed as level::FiatLux()

	* Real save is now removed and autosave is done when WMode is activated, to prevent
	  the potential abuse of the latter

July 23 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* The number of BodyParts and AllowedWeaponSkillCategories cached
	* Some S&R done:
	  * Description() -> GetDescription()
	  * PersonalPronoun() -> GetPersonalPronoun()
	  * PossessivePronoun() -> GetPossessivePronoun()
	  * ObjectPronoun() -> GetObjectPronoun()
	* There were some brackets missing in the attribute experience code, which caused them

	  with zero during creation

July 23 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

July 22 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* BurdenState and all non-trivial attack information is now cached

	* Many new bugs included

July 22 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Config screen now shows "disabled" as the autosave interval if it's zero and
	  "1 turn" if it's one (not "1 turns")
	* LOS is now updated immediately when perception is naturally increased;
	  previously you had to move before the sight range was increased
	* RaiseStats and LowerStats cheats now work correctly when one is polymorphed into
	  a nonhumanoid
	* Fixed an AP system bug that caused the AI of stationary monsters (most Attnamians
	  and carnivorous plants) to be run each tick instead of each turn, thus slowing
	  down the game considerably
	* Corrected the Great Attnamian Blitzkrieg Bug added by the last commit

July 21 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Consummos bad pray effect works.

July 21 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Scroll of create monster creates only one monster again (although I am not positively
	  sure whether that horde of monsters appearing was a bug or feature...)
	* Corrected a bug that caused that caused ESP-seen people on never seen squares to
	  darken after they were 'l'ooked at
	* HP and MaxHP of characters cached
	* Master and MaxHP of bodyparts cached
	* Added parentheses around the MAKE_RGB macro, because conditional expressions of the form
	  if(Color == MAKE_RGB(R, G, B)) caused a syntax error without it
	* Added a powerful colorized font cache system
	* Optimized weaponskill::Tick(), Regenerate functions, MainMaterial handling routines,
	  gear retrieval functions, and so on...

July 16 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Added rect struct to femath.h which can be easily used to define rectangles in 2D-space
	* DO_FILLED_RECTANGLE macros replaced with loops going through a rectangle generated by
	  femath::CalculateEnvironmentRectangle that uses the mentioned rect structure
	* Many key functions (GetBodyPart() etc.) unvirtualized to gain speed
	* Equally many small but often called functions moved to headers so that they can be inlined
	  (though I had to bury my mission of preventing Main's headers from including other Main's
	  headers)
	* Continued Hex's crusade against long lines by adding character::GetStackUnder() and
	  many xxx::GetNear(L)Square()s (shortcuts of xxx::GetArea/LevelUnder()->Get(L)Square()s)
	* Replaced a few statements of the form RAND() % (2^n) with the somewhat faster equivalent
	  RAND() & (2^n-1) (for instance, RAND() % 2 -> RAND() & 1)

July 15 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* added LevelUnder() to item, character and lterrain
	* Replaced code in item, character and lterrain and their derives to use LevelUnder().
	* Added GetPos() function to item 
	* Added stethoscope 
	* Snake is now "lying" not "standin"
	* You can no longer engrave when you cannot read.

July 15 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* SecretKnowledge command now offers information about the attack capabilities of every character
	* DO_FOR_SQUARES_AROUND macros have been replaced with loops using various GetNeighbourSquare()
	  functions

July 14 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Angels now carry a holy book of their divine master
	* Decreased the brigthness of palette entry 151 by 5 in all m-colored graphics files,
	  for it conflicted with the transparent color and caused problems with some image editors
	* Configuration is now saved even if the game is terminated abnormally
	* Corrected the remaining problems of the message history
	* Animations now work correctly during faint, reading, digging and similiar automated actions
	* Continent number and terrain height are again shown while looking on the world map when
	  SeeWholeMapCheat is active
	* Disabled the FOW on the world map, for IMO it doesn't make sense there (far away forests,
	  towns and continents are not "seen", after all, they are known to be there, and the
	  area revealed by moving around there is actually learnt from the natives' speeches etc.)
	* LOS range in the wilderness doesn't depend on perception anymore, for reasons explained above
	* Optimized the world map draw code greatly
	* Modified dungeon LOS so that when walking in darkness, only one square in each direction is
	  considered seen (it can be touched) and its memorized picture is updated. It was rather odd
	  that you could "see" darkness really far away before

July 13 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Added teleport control, teleport randomly and polymorph randomly states
	* Added rings for all these new states.

July 13 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Oceans and the dolphin pool are now animated
	* Decreased the global frame rate somewhat
	* Macro system tweaks

	* Corrected some bugs in the message history code, but not all of them
	* Corrected a minor problem with database Aliases

July 12 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Corrected many warnings given by gcc 3.04 compilation
	* Personal pronouns are now correct while looking at far away people while SeeWholeMapCheat is on
	* Dolphins are now rotated and mirrored randomly every turn, which makes them seem more playful
	* The second sentence of the kamikaze dwarf hymn message now starts correctly with an uppercase letter
	* Macro system is yet again a bit shorter and more elegant
	* Removed the unused function definitions of charde.h
	* Bodypart pictures of farmers and housewives are again randomized correctly
	* The flower color of the carnivorous plant is again randomized correctly
	* Adjusted brightness levels of many bodyparts in humanoid.pcx
	* Made some tiny corrections to the graphics in humanoid.pcx and char.pcx
	  (for instance, enner beasts mouth is again black and white, not m-color 1 and white)
	* Corrected all buggy bodypart BitmapPoses
	* Fixed all IMO ugly bodypart colors
	* There was also an attempt to optimize the level generation; as a result it's now somewhat slower
	* Stretchblit is now masked (I needed this feature for IGOR 1.20 that now includes a CW-like draw queue system)
	* Added colorizablebitmap::Roll(), which is able to simultaneously move the contents of a given rectangle
	  by an arbitrary amount of pixels horizontally and/or vertically so that the clipped pixels appear on the
	  opposite side (also needed for IGOR 1.20 as an option)
	* Added #defines for the eight direction keys to felibdef.h
	* Corrrected a typo in the monster polymorph message
	* ESP no longer crashes in the world map
	* Air is now transparent and thus are Bill's wills and the unclothed parts of genies, too
	* Mommo configs can again be generated
	* Added Flexibility material database value and removed the old IsFlexible boolean
	  (non-living bodyparts now use this as their dexterity or agility and the FormModifiers of
	  whips and belts are multiplied by it)
	* The strengths and agilities of nonhumanoids made of non-living materials are now correct
	* Characters with zero strength (eg. Bill's wills) can now move as long as they aren't carrying anything
	* Skeletons are no longer considered as bone golems when calculating strengths, dexterity and agility,
	  for IMO they draw their attributes from the necromantic magic that sustains them, not from the material
	  (and, it seemed very odd that animated skeletons were thrice as strong as average humans with similiar
	  skeletons inside them)
	* Corrected an extremely fatal bug of utmost deep roots that allowed the player to enter the dolphin
	  pool of the Cathedral by displacing a pet bat or angel flying over it, even though he couldn't swim
	  nor float himself
	* Added fiber material of which carnivorous plants are now made, instead of leaf (I firmly believe that the
	  stem is more important than leaves. Someone with a deeper understanding of plant anatomy correct me
	  if I'm wrong)
	* A player controlled carnivorous plant can no longer move
	* Banana peal golems are now allowed
	* Forced Ivan's plate mail to be made of iron again
	* Made a gum solution that allows angels and genies to have leg strengths and be able to carry things around
	  despite the fact that they don't have legs
	* Updated the Docs and moved the older files to the Obsolete directory
	* Added some truly ancient files concerning the earliest incarnations of IVAN there, too,
	  including even holydoc2.jpg, the legendary scanned documentation of RL1!
	* Translated the Finnish entries of Small Ideas.txt and Great Ideas.txt.
	  However, I did not touch Code Improvements.txt, since my English is not good enough to make them as
	  cryptical and incomprehensible as they are now. There is a notice also in the beginning of the file
	  explaining this. I didn't alter the entries of NextRelease.txt (former Remember2.txt) either,
	  since that file is highly temporary and thus a translation would be a waste of time
	* Added a bool character::StateIsSecret[] array that makes it possible to add secret states which
	  are not shown on the panel
	* Life saved and lycanthropy states are now secret

July 11 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Poisoned state added
	* spiders, school food and snakes to use the state

July 9 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Now compiles under gcc 3.1

July 8 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* BodyParts() search & replaced with GetBodyParts()
	* If SeeWholeMapCheat is active, character look info is now available even if the target can't be seen
	* Name functions are now much faster
	* New, *yet* faster techniques for string handling are available:
	  * AddName(String, Case); which is much faster than String += GetName(Case);
	  * String << AnotherString << Int << CString << Etc; which is much faster than
	    String += AnotherString + Int + CString + Etc; (you must #include "stdover.h" though)
	* Script generated altars again randomize their divine owner correctly
	* Attnam's and level 10's altars are again owned correctly

July 8 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* snake added (although it doesn't work)
	* angel healing friends fixed.

July 8 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Chest and unicorn look better now
	* Corrected The Unicorn of Godly Strength and Speed Spawning Bug
	* Decreased the brightness of palette index 148 by seven in all materialcolorized
	  graphics files (don't ask why)

July 8 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Added CreateDivineConfigurations boolean datavalue to all databases, which can be used
	  to add new god-dependent characters, items, materials and terrains very easily,
	  and to define varying attributes and specialities for them. It is now used for
	  angels, kamikaze dwarves, holy books and altars and reduces their overlapping code a lot,
	  and unique holy waters for each god and other similiar wonderful features are
	  a piece of cake with the new system
	* Angel, golem and genie graphics have been converted to humanoids by me. (btw, Kahvi is a moron)
	* All lterrains have been datafiled to glterra.dat and olterra.dat;
	  it is now possible to add new terrains without modifying code and blaah blaah
	* All glterrains have been converted as configurations of solidterrain and liquidterrain
	* Most olterrains have been converted as configurations of wall, decoration and container
	  (the latter holds the bookcase and is reserved for future use)
	* Integrated Kahvi's older looking walls for dungeon rooms
	* Finally integrated Kahvi's new chest picture
	* AnimationController no longer crashes when a full screen DOS prompt is activated in Windows
	* Cheated lookmode wilderness terrain descriptions don't disappear after the first glance anymore
	* Added periods at the end of some of Hex's incomplete messages
	* Corrected a memory leak in the fluid load code
	* Removed the seemingly ever-lasting problems with item's SquareUnder by removing it.
	  Instead, GetSquareUnder() now passes the request for position to Slot
	* The game now aborts if an unrecognized datavalue is found in the datafiles
	  (previously it just discarded it)
	* All script and datafile aborts now print the line number of the respective error
	* All low level inputfile aborts (like ReadNumber syntax errors) now print the file name and
	  the line number of the error (the latter only if it's appropriate, as it isn't for instance
	  in the case of an unexpected EOF error, since it always happens in the last line)
	* If the player isn't able to use certain equipment (usually due to a lost limb),
	  its slot isn't shown in the panel anymore even as an empty rectangle
	* Mine's explosion power now depends on its ContainedMaterial
	* Removed more than 1800 lines of obsolete code left commented all around the project
	  (but I didn't delete anything I wasn't sure to be irrelevant)
	* Angel and genie don't have legs nor a groin anymore (what a terrible fate)
	* Animation controller loops are now not run while wieving menus

July 6 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Poison state added.
	* Now compiles under GCC 3.1. Again problems with typenames in proto.cpp

July 5 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Temporary states whose counters are zero are now considered permanent intrinsics
	* The character database value PermanentStates renamed as ClassStates
	* The character data member PermanentState renamed as EquipmentState,
	  and the associated function names updated as well
	* Added BeginStateHandlers and EndStateHandlers that are called always when states
	  (either temporary, intrinsic or controlled) are activated/deactivated
	* Removed the old handler system used only when switching a temporary state on/off
	* Simplified the inner structure of the code in such way that haste and slow can now be
	  in effect simultaneously, but this is represented in the panel as if neither was active
	* Added infravision and ESP states
	* See invisible state removed, as infravision now confers the same benefits
	* HasInfraVision character database value removed
	* Added wand of invisibility
	* Added ring of infravision
	* Added amulet of ESP
	* Draw system rewritten completely to make draw functions far more flexible and
	  easier to use and to remove some duplicate code
	* Added transparency effect for invisible creatures sensed by infravision or ESP
	* Added object::MaxAlpha() function to make the adding of transparency effects again a bit easier
	* Characters seen by infravision or ESP are no longer affected by varying luminance;
	  instead they are always seen as if the light level was 256
	* Corrected a recently-added bug which caused AlterLuminance not to update
	  MemorizedDescription correctly when the first emitter was added
	* Added item::IsVisible(), stack::GetVisibleItems() and stack::GetBottomVisibleItem()
	  functions which allow the convenient use of hidden items
	* Script generated land mines and bear traps are now correctly invisible
	* Hidden items are now shown if SeeWholeMapCheat is on
	* Added iosystem::ScrollBarQuestion which acts as a graphical version of the normal NumberQuestion
	* Contrast can now be set with ScrollBarQuestion and the display is still updated constantly
	* Removed the increase and decrease contrast ('b' and 'B') commands
	* Separated the eat and drink ('e' and 'D') commands
	* Redefined much of the keyboard layout
	* Decreased reading times required when WMode is activated
	* Skeleton's TotalVolume and FleshMaterial are now correct

July 03 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

June 16 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Added equipment pictures to panel
	* The config system of items and characters works now correctly (I think).
	  This means that one can add new equipment or monsters without touching code at all,
	  using one of the existing classes as a base
	* Converted almost all weapons to configurations of meleeweapon.
	  Weapons not converted: pickaxe (special, can dig), whip (special, FormModifier depends on material),
	  Valpurus's Justifier and Neerc Se-Ulb (artifacts, will get animation functions soon)
	* Converted chain mail, amulets, rings and boots to configurations of their base classes
	* Added possibility to specify config in script in brackets following a classname

	* Removed the former way to set it

June 15 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Added GearStates item database value that allows one to easily add equipment that activate permanent states
	* Added PermanentStates character database value that makes it easy to add permanent states to certain races
	* Added boot of speed that hastes the user (but you need to have two of them equipped!)
	* Added a bug that activates permanent states when the user wields the right piece of equipment, like a boot of speed
	  (by the way, this bug did already exist with amulets of life saving)
	* Monsters are now polymorphed only temporarily in the same way as the player,
	  so you don't have to kill yourself when that goblin zaps its WoP at your ultra-trained level 8 mistress
	  (when it someday becomes wise enough to do it)
	* Added lycanthropy state that occasionally polymorphs the character into a werewolf (wolf form)
	* Werewolf flesh causes lycanthropy now
	* Remade werewolf; it is now a human-like creature that is permanently lycanthropic
	* Added wish functions for character and CanBeWished and Alias values to its database
	* Added polymorph control state
	* Added ring of polymorph control
	* Added life saving state and made amulet of life saving use it
	  (this allows very pleased gods to grant temporary life saving, for instance)
	* Removed the code that allowed fatness (I just couldn't work out how a gold golem can carry itself)
	* Nonhumanoids have now a chance to train their martial skills (unarmed combat, kicking or biting)
	* Biting doesn't make bodyparts fly anymore
	* Fixed a bug of temporarily hasted/slowed dogs crashing on world map
	* The wish parser is again more intelligent as it chooses the item with most correctly specified name parts,
	  so a wish for "that holy banana thingy" gives the holy banana of Liukas Vipro and not just a banana
	* Fixed a bug that caused golems' bodypart materials to be randomized individually,
	  thus creating fabric legged, stone armed and bone headed golems with wooden torsos etc.
	* Hunters are once again one armed
	* Added some new booleans to character database: CanUseEquipment, CanKick and CanTalk
	* Amulet's article is now correct

	* Added beartrap (which probably will need some more tweaking)

June 14 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Pool and LOS codes optimized greatly and character AI (which takes most of the processor time now) somewhat.
	  As a result running around Attnam with debug on is about 40% faster than before
	* Added Roundness database value for items (on scale ]0, 100])
	* It is now possible to block attacks with any item,
	  the possibility depending on size, roundness and To Hit Value and effect depending on StrengthValue
	* Shields work correctly: one cannot attack with them and their block chance is doubled
	* Doors' LockTypes and BoobyTraps are now saved correctly
	* The game doesn't crash anymore when fluid vanishes
	* Fixed a bug that caused a delay before the tamed symbol appeared over charmed monsters

June 11 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* The New Attribute System is now working
	* Most likely very badly
	* Wishing works again and probably better than before, since the spelling rules have been relaxed.
	  For instance, if one wishes (in WizardMode) for "the holy ultra-powerful broadsword
	  named "Valpurus's Justifier" that this Perttu-dude carries", the game will instantly know you mean
	  "holy broadsword "Valpurus's Justifier"", since the three key parts of the name exist somewhere in the wish string
	* Also added an alias system that allows one to define alternative names for items used by the wish system
	* Panel is now more informative
	* Kicking works again
	* If a character is armless, he kicks enemies, if also one- or zero-legged, bites them
	* Added an AttackStyle attribute to characterdatabase that controls how monsters will attack (with arms, legs and/or head)
	* Unicorns, mammoths and buffalos can now both kick and bite their enemies
	* If a chest is locked, the chest::Open doesn't ask whether the player wants to put in or take from it
	* Chest's contents are now deleted properly
	* BoolQuestion's OtherKeyForTrue works again
	* Doors can again be opened
	* Chests can now be unlocked and locked (well, the latter was in theory sometimes possible before, but only in theory)
	* The names of chests, doors and keys show their LockType verbally
	* Petrus's face turns correctly red during the Final Battle
	* Message history isn't drawn under highscores anymore
	* Added a system to determine whether a bodypart is the character's original one
	* Gear items emitate light correctly but updating still bugs
	* The game asks for key press when a bodypart is severed
	* Explosions sever bodyparts and spill blood more correctly
	* Polymorphing items works correctly
	* Decreased the characters' global possibility to hit weaker bodyparts
	* Corrected a bug that caused lights falling during an explosion to crash
	* Corrected a bug with doors that caused dummy boobytraps to spawn all the time
	* Probably much else that I have forgotten...

June 10 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Taking and putting things in chests is now handled correctly in special rooms.

	* Added mirroring, flipping and rotateing to items too.
	
June 02 2002 Heikki Sairanen <heikki.sairanen@phpoint.net>

	* Added chest. It seems to work probably but it can not be sold from a shop yet and the polymorph-code has not been tested, because of crashes in the polymorph code even without polymorphing a chest)
	* Cans are now more or less disabled.
	
May 31 2002 Timo Kiviluoto <sonor@phpoint.fi>

	* Pertus's wives (almost) work now
	* Added a new innovative super-powerful valuesystem that allows constants to be easily shared between code and script

	  (this is what you get when you plan your code in a Swedish textbook margin)
	* Instead added a global script define datafile which understands a format similiar to C/C++ preprocessor language:
	  project's release compilation time decreased by about 5%
	* Names and effects of materials datafiled
	* Ultra major structural change problematic enough to become a source for a thousand heroic coding sagas:
